🔁 What is a Doubly Linked List?
A Doubly Linked List is a type of linked list where each node contains:
Data (the actual value)
A pointer to the next node
A pointer to the previous node
So you can go forward and backward in the list!

🧱 Structure of a Node
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next; // points to the next node
    Node prev; // points to the previous node
}


🧠 Why Use a DLL?
Compared to a singly linked list, a DLL:
Allows traversal in both directions
Makes deleting a node faster (no need to track the previous node manually)

💡 How It Works (Example):
Let’s say we insert 10, 20, 30.

null <- [30] <-> [20] <-> [10] -> null
Each node knows both its next and previous node. 

🎯 Key Points to Remember
Use DLL when you need backward traversal.
Slightly more memory than singly linked list (because of extra prev pointer).
More flexible for inserting and deleting from both ends.
